    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose gluten-free flour</li>
        <li>Xanthum Gum</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Packed Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together gluten-free flour, xanthan (unless flour blend already has xanthan or guar gum), baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of your stand mixer, place the cream cheese, then pour melted butter over it. Add brown sugar and sugar and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. (I use the paddle attachment on my mixer.)</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract and egg yolks (one at a time) mixing on low-medium speed until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture that you set aside earlier, beating on low until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix on low or by hand, just until mixed thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours and up to 4 days.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to bake, remove from refrigerator and allow it to come closer to room temperature so you can scoop the cookies easily before baking.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Line cookie sheets with sheets of parchment paper or silicone liners. Do not spray!</li>
        <li>Use a #20 cookie scoop to scoop even mounds of cookie dough spaced several inches apart. I can get 12 per cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes at 375°. Remove when edges are set and just browning. The centers will look undercooked, but will continue cooking as they cool. To ensure you don't over bake, I suggest you bake a few test cookies so you can determine the right baking time for your oven. If you like gooey centers, cook less, if you like crunchier cookies, cook longer.</li>
        <li>If you'd like, you can sprinkle more chocolate chips on them once you remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for just 2-3 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
        <li>Enjoy and share!</li>
    
    </ol>
